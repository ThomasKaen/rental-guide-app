2025-11-29 — Project Start (v0.1.0)

Kicked off the new Rental Guide App — a digital guest guide for the company flats.
The idea is simple for now: a clean link guests can open on their phone to see all important details without sifting through WhatsApp messages or PDFs.

Today’s achievements:

Set up the repository and folder structure.

Configured SSH keys properly (classic alias issue again).

Spun up a FastAPI backend.

Built the very first guest page at /guide/company-flat-1.

Implemented a SaaS-inspired UI with clean cards and a modern feel.

Added the first version of the project changelog.

The app successfully starts — Phase 1 foundation complete.

General thoughts:
Feels good to build something that is both internal-useful and has potential to evolve into a product later. Keep things simple now, worry about admin UI and multi-property support when needed.

Next I want to:

Start shaping Phase 2 (basic admin UI or backend endpoints for editing data).

Or maybe just refine the UI a bit more and ensure everything looks “product-ready,” even in static form.

But for today — it runs, it looks good, and it’s real.
